        <text>Written Questions</text><br><br>
        <text>1. I answer the question asking about the number of titles per genre with a bar chart that displays
            each genre and the associated number of titles. I answer the question about average runtime by year
            by providing a similar bar chart that gives the average runtime for movies in each year. I planned to add
            a trendline, or perhaps error bars, to this graph that the user could add at the press of a button. I attempted
            to answer the question about actors who are in the same movies by making a flow diagram that displays the 
            actors (only those who are in a significant number of movies) as nodes and movies that they are in together as links 
            between the nodes, with a tooltip to show more information.
        </text><br><br>
        <text>2. D3 is helpful for making visualizations interactive, it supports manipulation data built in within it, 
            and it has a large number of available graphs and presets to help build interesting graphs.
        </text><br><br>
        <text>3. Using D3 was more difficult than building visualizations with a what you see is what you get application,
             although using such an application and adding it to the webpage as an image would not allow for interactivity;
             when using D3 you are limited to some extent by the number of functions and presets available in the library;
             D3 requires very well-cleaned and processed data to use
            </text><br><br>
        <text>4. In the second reading, it mentions visually impaired users, including
            those who are colorblind, as key accessibility demographics, and notes that people with disabilities constitute up to a quarter of the population.  I wasn't able to get the whole dashboard completed, and what I currently have probably wouldn't present too many
            accessbility challenges to people using assistive technology.
            However, if I were able to complete my whole plan for the dashboard, one issue might be the tooltip, which would be difficult for people using screen readers to use. It might be difficult
            to display this information as readable test, though, because it would clutter the interface significantly. Perhaps I could think about
            a way to display the text in a way that could be read by screen readers but is not all on the page at once. Finally, for colorblind users,
            my dashboard doesn't currently present any challenges - I used a single color for each of the bar graphs, and in my node graph I would
            try to use colors that aren't confusing for those with common forms of colorblindness, although differentiating between colors wouldn't 
            even be essential to viewing the graph.
        </text><br><br>
        <text>5. I wasn't able to take these steps mostly because of a lack of time, but also as I noted in my last answer
            that changing the tooltip or providing an alternative would probably make the interface much more cluttered and negatively
            impact the appeal of the visualization. This is due to how much extra information would have to be displayed that is accessed by means
            of the tooltip. I also could have thought more about accessibility when planning my dashboard, and chosen other charts to display information
            in ways that would minimize this problem (perhaps forgoing the node flow chart for another type would be a good idea for accessibility purposes).
